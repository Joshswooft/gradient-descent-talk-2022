# Gradient Descent

## Description
This project explores how we can use supervised learning to solve a regression problem; predict the sale price of a house given a particular age. The algorithm chosen here is gradient descent with univariant linear regression as a base model. 

## Common Terms
Gradient Descent is a machine learning algorithm which is used to find the local minima (or global minima in convex functions) of a given cost function. 

Machine learning is the science of getting computers to learn without being explicitly programmed. - Arthur Samuel (1959)

Supervised learning is when you give the computer all the input, output pairs for the training data.
